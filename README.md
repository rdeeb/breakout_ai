# An Artificial Neural Network that Plays a breakout game

So after a few years of this repo being around I decided to update it to use TensorFlow.js and a nicer version of the
game.

## Running the app

Download the git repository, go to your console and install the dependencies

```
$ yarn install
```

Now run the server

```
$ yarn start-dev
```

## License

Off course it's released under the MIT license... do whatever you want

## Warranty

In no way I can be held liable if your computer suddenly explodes or you feel harmed in any way, this is intended as training
material, and haven't been properly tested.
